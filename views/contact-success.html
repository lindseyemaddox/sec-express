                      <div class="story">
                        <p>John has been serving the risk management needs of local governments in some form or fashion since 1975. He founded NGU in 1999 after an accomplished 15-year career at Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., where he held several leadership positions and was decorated with numerous achievement awards for producing and product innovation, including a banner year in 1997 when he was honored as the #1 producer in the entire nation. Maybe this success is why some of John's competitors have cause for concern, we're not sure. </p><a class="arrow" href="#moreevans">More</a>

                          <div class="container">
                            <p>But his customers and employees sure seem to love and respect him and that's what's important to him. John is responsible for creating a culture at NGU where everybody loves to work here. They really do and it's an uncommon thing to see. </p>
                            <p>John also has a history of serving in the public sector, having been elected as mayor of Clinton, Arkansas, at the age of 21, a position he held from 1975-1978, then as councilman for the City of North Little Rock from 1985-1989. John also ran for the Arkansas state legislature in 1990. This public service gives him the unique perspective that helps him understand the public sector and government entities unlike most. </p>
                            <p>"I want each of my clients and employees to get the absolute best there is to offer and know exactly what to expect," says John. "I want them to feel comfortable in their relationship with me and this company and know that their decision to work with NGU is the best decision they have ever made. I want them to know that I am always here when they need help. I love to see someone walk into my office or life with a look of despair and see them leave with a smile on their face, motivated to tackle the world." </p>
                            <p>Not shy about his beliefs in the proper role of government and personal responsibility, John uses his time, influence and resources to affect the political process at the local, state and federal level. He regularly supports candidates and causes that share his belief in limited government and individual liberties. When John is not working, he enjoys quiet time alone for introspection and self-evaluation, which he does in many ways like riding a lawnmower or working with any piece of machinery that doesn't talk back to him. You might also find him sitting on a backhoe digging tree stumps or bush hogging on his farm, woodworking, rebuilding an engine for a friend's car or welding together a boat dock that he designed and built from scratch. We know it's weird that this kind of stuff is fun and relaxing to him, but it is. </p>
                            <p>John was born and raised in Clinton, Arkansas, where his father was a state trooper and his grandfather was a grass and cattle farmer. He gained a healthy respect for law and order from his father, but he spent most of his free time with his grandfather learning on the farm. John came to Tennessee in 1994 after the pool program he started for the state's schools began to grow so much, he needed to be here to oversee its operations and growth. And he's loved it here ever since.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                        <p>Betsey has been with NGU since 1999, coming aboard roughly three months after John Evans founded the company. She has an uncanny ability to soothe clients who get irritated or concerned over their current situation. Given her position, it's important for her to be able to multi-task, which she does considerably well. It's her job to make sure that our customers talk to a live person to resolve their issues and she's always there for them. She has been in the insurance industry since 1978, so she has lots of experience making sure that her customers are taken care of. </p><a class="arrow" href="#moresullivan">More</a>

Some people might find that annoying, but I embrace it because it means they trust that I have everything in order for them," says Betsey. "I just enjoy making people happy." </p>
                            <p>Her biggest personal passion is her family. She enjoys spending time with her children and grand kids. She enjoys traveling, reading, swimming, boating, quilting, making crafts, sewing and watching Alabama football. She is passionate about finding homes for abandoned dogs and cats, so Betsey loves volunteering at animal shelters. And every afternoon, her own dog takes her for a walk. She also does volunteer work at her church and her granddaughters' school. </p>
                            <p>Betsey was born in South Dakota but, as the daughter of a military family, she grew up all around the country.  When her father retired, they moved to Tennessee, where she went to college, but she moved around a couple times before settling in Nashville.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

And it's no wonder he's so well versed; he's been working in the insurance industry since 1984. He has a knack for plowing through numbers and data, then being able to translate that into information that someone can understand and act on. </p>

                            <p>When he's not working, Jeff will be found with his kids participating in their activities and staying very active in leadership positions with his church. He loves being at his kids' football and baseball games as much as he enjoys singing in the church choir, where he also plays the handbells. Always trying to put his financial skills to good use, he is the treasurer at his church and the Donelson Christian Academy Athletic Booster Club. He also serves on the board for Mt. Juliet Little League and serves as an assistant for Music City Classics baseball Team, which his oldest son plays for. </p>

                            <p>"I strive to make their job easier and more efficient while providing an up-to-date, secure, available, and stable IT infrastructure," says Kyle. "I do my best to be proactive with maintenance to minimize downtime so they can work and serve our clients without interruption from any technical problem." </p>
                            <p>Of course, when you're the IT guy, you have to use your skills outside of the company and he often finds himself taking care of his extended family's computer and technology needs as well. He loves learning new technologies and is constantly adding to his geek power. And while he can't stand reality TV, he enjoys watching documentaries on the planet, universe, survival, and wildlife. </p>
                            <p>Kyle is always talking about his sons, Ethan, Eli, and his newest addition Kingston.  Kyle absolutely loves spending time with them. Together, they enjoy basketball, soccer, video games, Judo, and Wado-Ryu Karate. Kyle loves showing his sons the world around them. Kyle's hidden talents include his alleged exceptional cooking abilities. His family swears by his carrot cake, which they say is awesome. He also does a mean Cajun turkey for Thanksgiving that the holiday is lackluster without, so he has made two every year for nearly the last decade. And during the summer, Kyle is master of the grill, firing up some tasty burgers, steaks, and brats that are apparently all the rave by those who have had the pleasure. (Or at least that's what he tells us.)</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                        <p>Ruby joined NGU in early 2012 when she was referred to the company by a retiring NGU employee who was helping find her replacement. When Ruby interviewed for the job, it felt like a perfect fit for her, having worked in the insurance business for 25 years serving very similar clients. NGU agreed that Ruby was the perfect addition to the company and she was promptly hired. She obtained her insurance agent's license in 2005. </p><a class="arrow" href="#morekeith">More</a>

                            <p>Ruby prides herself on her ability to work with people, making sure she tends to their needs and effectively resolves issues they have encountered with compassion and professionalism. It's not just customers who appreciate Ruby's style, it's her teammates as well. Her reputation for being trusted by colleagues is something she is proud of and works hard to achieve. She is the consummate team player, always supporting others and staying in constant communication to ensure that issues are resolved quickly and appropriately. </p>
                            <p>"My clients will compliment me on the way I handle their needs in a timely, courteous manner," says Ruby. "If I do not have the answer, I won't stop until I find the answer for them. What drives me and so many of us is the fact that when we're not working we're customers too. We know what it's like to not be respected as a customer, so it motivates me to make sure my customers feel valued, understood and cared for." </p>
                            <p>When she's not busy making clients happy, Ruby likes to give of her time by helping to fundraise for the Ronald McDonald House and participating in walks for various other charities such as the American Cancer Society, Autism Speaks and St. Jude Children's Hospital. </p>
                            <p>Ruby grew up in Old Hickory, Tennessee, a suburb east of Nashville. Most of her family is in the Nashville area so she considers it home and plans to always be here. With such a large family, as one of 7 children, she often finds herself going to plays, concerts and other functions with her grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. She also enjoys vacationing with them during the summers. (This explains why she's such a people person.) </p>
                            <p>Ruby hopes to be remembered as someone people can count on if they need a friend or encouragement, someone who can cheer others up when they are down.  Professionally, she wants to be thought of as someone who always works hard and keeps a positive attitude about any project that she takes on. NGU is lucky to have her.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                            <p>Tom obtained his agent's license in 2006 and for the past few years has taken on an increasingly active role in NGU's agency management, sales and marketing while he continues to manage and lead SEC.  Tom's claims management background has given him a broad knowledge of coverage and insurance products that has proven to be an asset to each company. </p>
                            <p>An avid outdoorsman, Tom loves his horses, though he only owns two now. He doesn't have the horses for show, but to ride, and he enjoys going camping on horseback. Believe it or not, Tom had a horse before he had his first bicycle. When he's not in the office or with his horses, you'll find Tom spending time with his children and 3 grandchildren, hiking, hunting, and during football season, cheering on the Tennessee Titans at LP Field. He and his wife also love traveling and dining out together. </p>
                            <p>Born in Portland, Oregon, Tom and his family moved to Tennessee when he was in the 3rd grade, so he considers this home for him.  He graduated from Middle Tennessee State University, and has lived in and around Nashville ever since.  Tom's sense of humor is probably what he's best known for, and with all of the important work going on at NGU, it's good to have a little comic relief now and then.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                  <h3 class="headline full">Below are some questions we are frequently asked. However, every situation is different, so please contact us to confirm your particular situation applies. </h3>
                  <p class="q">A parent wants to let a school employee use their personal vehicle to transport a golf team to a match. Is there a form that will release the vehicle owner from liability in case of an injury to any of the passengers?</p>
                  <p class="a">No. The owner of the vehicle cannot be released from liability. In Tennessee, the insurance follows the vehicle.</p>
                  <p class="q">A coach sometimes drives his own vehicle to ball games to haul necessary equipment. Is his vehicle covered and is his liability covered for this operation?</p>
                  <p class="a">Since the coach is the owner and the operator of the vehicle identified above, even though he is on school business, he is not a named insured nor is his vehicle insured. However, damage that he may do to property or person of others on school business is covered with respect to liability of the school system or its board or employees other than the coach.</p>
                  <p class="q">What malpractice coverage is there for Health Department nurses?</p>
                  <p class="a">There is incidental medical malpractice for the Health Dept. nurses who are performing duties, including dispensing drugs and vaccinations, in the capacity of their employment with the Member.  If they are performing duties outside their employment with the Member, they would need their own personal malpractice insurance.  This would pertain to temporary nurses, as well.</p><a class="arrow" href="#morefaq">More</a>

                      <div class="container">
                        <p class="q">Are volunteer firemen covered under our Workers Compensation policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">Yes. Volunteer firemen may be covered under Workers Compensation.  The TN Workers Compensation Act provides that Workers Comp coverage for volunteers, if chosen by the Member, covers medical benefits only as provided by the statute.  The Act does not provide indemnity or wage replacement for volunteers.  This benefit, as provided by the Act, is the exclusive remedy available to volunteers under the TNRMT document.  There is a form which accompanies our application that gives the Member the opportunity to select Volunteer coverage, if desired.</p>
                        <p class="q">Are there any restrictions, age, etc. concerning the drivers employed by the Member?</p>
                        <p class="a">The TNRMT does not dictate any restrictions concerning drivers or other employees.  It is assumed that the Member will not put anyone into a position before he/she is well trained, responsible, and trusted by the Member to properly perform the requirements of his/her job.  The Member puts its own liability at risk for these decisions and it is presumed they will protect their interests in employee situations.</p>
                        <p class="q">Are government-owned vehicles required to have ID cards?</p>
                        <p class="a">No. However, if you are planning on out-of-state trips, you should have an ID card. The requirements vary by state. Within the state of Tennessee, per Financial Responsibility Chapter No. 292 Public Acts, 2001, vehicles are not required to have them. They meet the Financial Requirement per section (a) (3) of the act: "The motor vehicle being operated at the time of the violation was owned by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the department of safety or the interstate commerce commission, or was owned by the United States, this state or any political subdivision thereof, and that such motor vehicle was being operated with the owner's consent."</p>
                        <p class="q">If Tennessee State Law is followed whereby home school students are allowed to participate in school-sponsored athletics and extracurricular activities, what is the position of the TNRMT Student Accident coverage for the home-schooled students?</p>
                        <p class="a">Under the Student and Athletic coverage, "student" is defined as a student enrolled in a participating school at the time of the accident. Since a home-schooled participant would not meet the eligibility requirements, a home-schooled student would not have any coverage under the TNRMT program. Thus, the school's athletic program should require the home-schooled student to provide proof of coverage as an additional insured for the purposes of liability to the school.</p>
                        <p class="q">Is Workers Compensation provided for students who are doing work at school for which they are being paid?</p>
                        <p class="a">Yes but this payroll must be included in the final audit for the term.</p>
                        <p class="q">We will be doing extensive remodeling to one of our buildings. Will this work be covered by our liability policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">No. You will need to have a separate builder's risk policy issued to cover this exposure.  Please contact us for assistance in securing this coverage.</p>
                        <p class="q">If a volunteer, parent, employee, or student uses his or her personal vehicle to transport students to a school activity or as part of their employment, will the vehicle and its occupants be covered by the school's policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">No. Tennessee State Law requires that the owner/operator of a vehicle is the primary person responsible for maintaining adequate coverage.</p><a class="arrow" href="#faq">FAQ</a>

I like the personality of our representative. If he doesn't have the answer, he can always put us in touch with the people that can meet our needs, but I've never asked for anything they couldn't deliver. Having a relationship with NGU means I can rest assured that there is a professional representing our interests."</p>

                        <p>"We are so grateful for the service and responsiveness of NGU. We have enjoyed our experience with them. We don't have to wait for answers, they are extremely responsive. Our relationship with NGU gives me the peace of mind that we will always be taken care of when we need them. It's hard to imagine what our risk management program would be like without NGU by our side. They keep their promises and that's a trust you can't put a price tag on."</p>

                        <p>"I like talking to a live person, not automated systems and that's the personal service that NGU provides to us. They follow up with me and I know that I can always call them in a heartbeat and they will be there. They do what they say they will do and always honor their commitments. Our risk management program was a headache before we started using NGU and now I'm happy to say it's one less thing I have to worry about."</p>

They have always been proactive, not reactive and I would highly recommend them to anyone. They are loyal and responsive to us and we return that loyalty and greatly appreciate what they do for us. They are always looking out for our best interests to see where we can improve, so in a way, they're like a security blanket to me."</p><a class="arrow" href="#intro">Our Tradition</a>

                        <p>John has been serving the risk management needs of local governments in some form or fashion since 1975. He founded NGU in 1999 after an accomplished 15-year career at Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., where he held several leadership positions and was decorated with numerous achievement awards for producing and product innovation, including a banner year in 1997 when he was honored as the #1 producer in the entire nation. Maybe this success is why some of John's competitors have cause for concern, we're not sure. </p><a class="arrow" href="#moreevans">More</a>

                            <p>But his customers and employees sure seem to love and respect him and that's what's important to him. John is responsible for creating a culture at NGU where everybody loves to work here. They really do and it's an uncommon thing to see. </p>
                            <p>John also has a history of serving in the public sector, having been elected as mayor of Clinton, Arkansas, at the age of 21, a position he held from 1975-1978, then as councilman for the City of North Little Rock from 1985-1989. John also ran for the Arkansas state legislature in 1990. This public service gives him the unique perspective that helps him understand the public sector and government entities unlike most. </p>
                            <p>"I want each of my clients and employees to get the absolute best there is to offer and know exactly what to expect," says John. "I want them to feel comfortable in their relationship with me and this company and know that their decision to work with NGU is the best decision they have ever made. I want them to know that I am always here when they need help. I love to see someone walk into my office or life with a look of despair and see them leave with a smile on their face, motivated to tackle the world." </p>
                            <p>Not shy about his beliefs in the proper role of government and personal responsibility, John uses his time, influence and resources to affect the political process at the local, state and federal level. He regularly supports candidates and causes that share his belief in limited government and individual liberties. When John is not working, he enjoys quiet time alone for introspection and self-evaluation, which he does in many ways like riding a lawnmower or working with any piece of machinery that doesn't talk back to him. You might also find him sitting on a backhoe digging tree stumps or bush hogging on his farm, woodworking, rebuilding an engine for a friend's car or welding together a boat dock that he designed and built from scratch. We know it's weird that this kind of stuff is fun and relaxing to him, but it is. </p>
                            <p>John was born and raised in Clinton, Arkansas, where his father was a state trooper and his grandfather was a grass and cattle farmer. He gained a healthy respect for law and order from his father, but he spent most of his free time with his grandfather learning on the farm. John came to Tennessee in 1994 after the pool program he started for the state's schools began to grow so much, he needed to be here to oversee its operations and growth. And he's loved it here ever since.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

She has an uncanny ability to soothe clients who get irritated or concerned over their current situation.

                            <p>When she's not busy making clients happy, Ruby likes to give of her time by helping to fundraise for the Ronald McDonald House and participating in walks for various other charities such as the American Cancer Society, Autism Speaks and St. Jude Children's Hospital. </p>
                            <p>Ruby grew up in Old Hickory, Tennessee, a suburb east of Nashville. Most of her family is in the Nashville area so she considers it home and plans to always be here. With such a large family, as one of 7 children, she often finds herself going to plays, concerts and other functions with her grandchildren and many nieces and nephews. She also enjoys vacationing with them during the summers. (This explains why she's such a people person.) </p>
                            <p>Ruby hopes to be remembered as someone people can count on if they need a friend or encouragement, someone who can cheer others up when they are down.

                            <p>An avid outdoorsman, Tom loves his horses, though he only owns two now. He doesn't have the horses for show, but to ride, and he enjoys going camping on horseback. Believe it or not, Tom had a horse before he had his first bicycle. When he's not in the office or with his horses, you'll find Tom spending time with his children and 3 grandchildren, hiking, hunting, and during football season, cheering on the Tennessee Titans at LP Field. He and his wife also love traveling and dining out together. </p>
                            <p>Born in Portland, Oregon, Tom and his family moved to Tennessee when he was in the 3rd grade, so he considers this home for him.  He graduated from Middle Tennessee State University, and has lived in and around Nashville ever since.  Tom's sense of humor is probably what he's best known for, and with all of the important work going on at NGU, it's good to have a little comic relief now and then.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                  <p class="q">A parent wants to let a school employee use their personal vehicle to transport a golf team to a match. Is there a form that will release the vehicle owner from liability in case of an injury to any of the passengers?</p>
                  <p class="a">No. The owner of the vehicle cannot be released from liability. In Tennessee, the insurance follows the vehicle.</p>
                  <p class="q">A coach sometimes drives his own vehicle to ball games to haul necessary equipment. Is his vehicle covered and is his liability covered for this operation?</p>
                  <p class="a">Since the coach is the owner and the operator of the vehicle identified above, even though he is on school business, he is not a named insured nor is his vehicle insured. However, damage that he may do to property or person of others on school business is covered with respect to liability of the school system or its board or employees other than the coach.</p>
                  <p class="q">What malpractice coverage is there for Health Department nurses?</p>
                  <p class="a">There is incidental medical malpractice for the Health Dept. nurses who are performing duties, including dispensing drugs and vaccinations, in the capacity of their employment with the Member.  If they are performing duties outside their employment with the Member, they would need their own personal malpractice insurance.  This would pertain to temporary nurses, as well.</p><a class="arrow" href="#morefaq">More</a>

                        <p class="q">Are volunteer firemen covered under our Workers Compensation policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">Yes. Volunteer firemen may be covered under Workers Compensation.  The TN Workers Compensation Act provides that Workers Comp coverage for volunteers, if chosen by the Member, covers medical benefits only as provided by the statute.  The Act does not provide indemnity or wage replacement for volunteers.  This benefit, as provided by the Act, is the exclusive remedy available to volunteers under the TNRMT document.  There is a form which accompanies our application that gives the Member the opportunity to select Volunteer coverage, if desired.</p>
                        <p class="q">Are there any restrictions, age, etc. concerning the drivers employed by the Member?</p>
                        <p class="a">The TNRMT does not dictate any restrictions concerning drivers or other employees.  It is assumed that the Member will not put anyone into a position before he/she is well trained, responsible, and trusted by the Member to properly perform the requirements of his/her job.  The Member puts its own liability at risk for these decisions and it is presumed they will protect their interests in employee situations.</p>
                        <p class="q">Are government-owned vehicles required to have ID cards?</p>
                        <p class="a">No. However, if you are planning on out-of-state trips, you should have an ID card. The requirements vary by state. Within the state of Tennessee, per Financial Responsibility Chapter No. 292 Public Acts, 2001, vehicles are not required to have them. They meet the Financial Requirement per section (a) (3) of the act: "The motor vehicle being operated at the time of the violation was owned by a carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the department of safety or the interstate commerce commission, or was owned by the United States, this state or any political subdivision thereof, and that such motor vehicle was being operated with the owner's consent."</p>
                        <p class="q">If Tennessee State Law is followed whereby home school students are allowed to participate in school-sponsored athletics and extracurricular activities, what is the position of the TNRMT Student Accident coverage for the home-schooled students?</p>
                        <p class="a">Under the Student and Athletic coverage, "student" is defined as a student enrolled in a participating school at the time of the accident. Since a home-schooled participant would not meet the eligibility requirements, a home-schooled student would not have any coverage under the TNRMT program. Thus, the school's athletic program should require the home-schooled student to provide proof of coverage as an additional insured for the purposes of liability to the school.</p>
                        <p class="q">Is Workers Compensation provided for students who are doing work at school for which they are being paid?</p>
                        <p class="a">Yes but this payroll must be included in the final audit for the term.</p>
                        <p class="q">We will be doing extensive remodeling to one of our buildings. Will this work be covered by our liability policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">No. You will need to have a separate builder's risk policy issued to cover this exposure.  Please contact us for assistance in securing this coverage.</p>
                        <p class="q">If a volunteer, parent, employee, or student uses his or her personal vehicle to transport students to a school activity or as part of their employment, will the vehicle and its occupants be covered by the school's policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">No. Tennessee State Law requires that the owner/operator of a vehicle is the primary person responsible for maintaining adequate coverage.</p><a class="arrow" href="#faq">FAQ</a>

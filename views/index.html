                        <p>"With SEC, I know I'm getting the most affordable coverage, but the service is what keeps me happy with them. They're incredibly easy to work with. They give me the freedom to not worry, knowing that we will be taken care of by them. Their knowledge of government services is critical to us and a great value to our operational security. If we had to go with someone else, it would take a lot of hard work to get back to the same level of comfort we have with SEC."</p>

I feel like they are a valued part of our team, they make recommendations on how we can be safer, and more responsible with the taxpayer's dollars. It's good to have someone who has that expertise since I'm an educator. They are just an awesome resource to use, they will help you to improve in all areas."</p>

I couldn't imagine doing my job without their knowledge. They are much more than a vendor to us, they are a strategic partner and it scares me to think what we would be without their knowledge. You're always treated on a very personal, first-name basis. It's unique, they have compassion, understanding. Even if we're not managing through a claim, they go out of their way to come see us, sometimes just to drop by and say ‘hi'."</p>

                  <p class="intro">What I admire about our unique approach is that SEC engages employees at all levels of our clients' organizations, which greatly improves the potential for safety success. In all phases of our programs, we work with our clients as partners. We improve our clients' abilities to work safely by consulting with and teaching management, supervisors, and employees the necessary skills to maintain and improve safety performance. We provide simple, yet effective common-sense awareness and skills to observe and manage the kinds of attributes and behaviors that cause injuries. Our team approach is the most successful method of assuring the success of this program.</p>
                  <p class="intro">The care we all take in dealing with our customers is what I think they appreciate so much about our partnership with them. On the front end, we investigate and determine where risks could be reduced and advise them on actions they should take. On the back end, when a claim is filed against one of our clients, we ensure a just and equitable outcome for both parties. We certainly stand behind our client, but if they are liable for wrongdoing, then we will take accountability for their actions and make things right with the claimant.</p>
                  <p class="intro">The most enjoyable part of working here at SEC is seeing people take ownership of their safety concerns, knowing that they have the power to control a great deal of what happens in their environment with the right planning and change of behavior on their end. </p>

                  <p class="subhead">SEC engages employees at all levels of our clients' organizations, which greatly improves the potential for safety success. Our unique safety engineering program is designed to empower our clients to manage their risks and loss exposures by providing both the structure and tools of a formal risk control approach. Our analysis, inspection, and evaluation methodology is designed to identify and assess the impact of loss exposures and risks of individual departments or through a client's organization. The analysis and evaluation process helps prioritize those areas which we feel can provide the most economic benefit from further loss control activities. Audits and surveys may also be used on an ongoing basis to monitor the effectiveness of risk control or safety programs currently in place. We understand that employees need to be helped to recognize what is at stake for themselves, their families, their co-workers and their employers, and how to make the right choices when it comes to working safely. Our safety engineers use a proven process and methodology in their work. Results are achieved by: </p>
                  <ul class="reg">
                    <li>Performing a loss analysis based on information from our underwriting division</li>
                    <li>Explaining the results of the loss analysis to client management</li>
                    <li>Implementing management-driven programs to establish commitment to safety</li>
                    <li>Use project-driven initiatives to form safety committees and direct the programs</li>
                    <li>Work through safety committees to schedule training, develop programs, and promote safety awareness</li>
                    <li>Address federal, state, and local issues through our compliance-driven programs</li>
                    <li>Evaluate status of clients' attitudes, safety programs, and losses</li>

                  <h3 class="headline">Safety Awareness</h3>
                  <p class="subhead">We teach clients techniques to observe their own safety attitudes, thinking, and behaviors with regard to safety. We help people learn how to identify and heed early warning signs which could lead to an accident, failure or lawsuit. Attitude change toward safety concerns must precede behavior change. </p>
                  <h3 class="headline">Modifying At-Risk Behavior</h3>
                  <p class="subhead">We provide training to induce behavior change in employees, which results in a safer overall environment and self-monitoring ability among the staff of an organization. </p>
                  <h3 class="headline">Personal Responsibility</h3>
                  <p class="subhead">Through specialized training and self-monitoring techniques, we increase the level of personal ownership and responsibility for safety. This is a key to influencing safe individual actions. </p>

                        <p>John has been serving the risk management needs of local governments in some form or fashion since 1975. He founded NGU in 1999 after an accomplished 15-year career at Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., where he held several leadership positions and was decorated with numerous achievement awards for producing and product innovation, including a banner year in 1997 when he was honored as the #1 producer in the entire nation. Maybe this success is why some of John's competitors have cause for concern, we're not sure. </p><a class="arrow" href="#moreevans">More</a>

                            <p>But his customers and employees sure seem to love and respect him and that's what's important to him. John is responsible for creating a culture at NGU where everybody loves to work here. They really do and it's an uncommon thing to see. </p>
                            <p>John also has a history of serving in the public sector, having been elected as mayor of Clinton, Arkansas, at the age of 21, a position he held from 1975-1978, then as councilman for the City of North Little Rock from 1985-1989. John also ran for the Arkansas state legislature in 1990. This public service gives him the unique perspective that helps him understand the public sector and government entities unlike most. </p>
                            <p>"I want each of my clients and employees to get the absolute best there is to offer and know exactly what to expect," says John. "I want them to feel comfortable in their relationship with me and this company and know that their decision to work with NGU is the best decision they have ever made. I want them to know that I am always here when they need help. I love to see someone walk into my office or life with a look of despair and see them leave with a smile on their face, motivated to tackle the world." </p>
                            <p>Not shy about his beliefs in the proper role of government and personal responsibility, John uses his time, influence and resources to affect the political process at the local, state and federal level. He regularly supports candidates and causes that share his belief in limited government and individual liberties. When John is not working, he enjoys quiet time alone for introspection and self-evaluation, which he does in many ways like riding a lawnmower or working with any piece of machinery that doesn't talk back to him. You might also find him sitting on a backhoe digging tree stumps or bush hogging on his farm, woodworking, rebuilding an engine for a friend's car or welding together a boat dock that he designed and built from scratch. We know it's weird that this kind of stuff is fun and relaxing to him, but it is. </p>
                            <p>John was born and raised in Clinton, Arkansas, where his father was a state trooper and his grandfather was a grass and cattle farmer. He gained a healthy respect for law and order from his father, but he spent most of his free time with his grandfather learning on the farm. John came to Tennessee in 1994 after the pool program he started for the state's schools began to grow so much, he needed to be here to oversee its operations and growth. And he's loved it here ever since.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                            <p>Paul started his career with Liberty Mutual in Montgomery, Ala., where he worked for nearly seven year years. He then worked as a resident adjuster for American States in West Tennessee, and then moved to Nashville, where he opened a claims office for the company and served as the claims manager. When Safeco bought American States in the late 1990s, he worked as a unit manager for Safeco and then as a large-loss handler, where he mostly focused on handling litigation, coverage, and complex claims. In 2008, Liberty Mutual bought Safeco, which meant he had come full circle to where he started his career.</p>
                            <p>Now, as a senior claims representative, Paul focuses on investigating, evaluating, and dispositioning claims for members. Because the majority of his work involves handling claims that involve lawsuits, he often works with attorneys to discuss and update legal plans, including negotiation and settlements. And because he's detailed oriented, regardless of who picks up one of his files, he or she knows every detail of the claim.</p>
                            <p>He's passionate about learning and continuing his education, incorporating the things he's learned over the years in his daily life. During his tenured career, he's served as the president of the Nashville Claims Managers Counsel and also spent 28 years as an arbitrator with Arbitration Forums, hearing inter-company disputes. In 2004, he received an award for being the arbitrator of the year with Arbitration Forums.</p>
                            <p>In his spare time, he enjoys spending time with his family, including taking to the open road with his wife in their motorhome to go camping. He also enjoys working around the house, unless it's football season. In that case, you'll find him in Knoxville tailgating with family and friends and cheering on the Tennessee Vols.</p>
                            <p>Paul changed his college major three times—from computer science to computer programming to accounting—before earning his bachelor's degree in business administration from Tennessee Technical University in Cookeville, Tenn.</p><a class="arrow" href="#people">Our People</a>

                  <h2 class="mobile">FAQ</h2>
                  <h3 class="headline full">Below are some questions we are frequently asked. However, every situation is different, so please contact us to confirm your particular situation applies. </h3>
                  <p class="q">Can SEC assist our entity with a TOSHA audit?</p>
                  <p class="a">It is our intention to be a total solution to minimize the stress factors related to TOSHA audits. Generally, we can help you prepare a written audit response and provide on-site training within a few days to assure timely response to the TOSHA auditors.</p>
                  <p class="q">Can you help me complete my OSHA 300 logs?</p>
                  <p class="a">Yes and no.  We do not capture all data required for the OSHA 300 report in our system.  We can, however, provide a listing of the worker compensation claims that were submitted to us during the reporting period. You can then use that list to gather other necessary information-such as total days off work-from your internal payroll records and other sources.</p>
                  <p class="q">How do the various deductibles in the program apply?</p>
                  <p class="a">Generally, member deductibles in the TNRMT program can be categorized as either first party or third party. An example of a first party deductible is the collision deductible.  Once we agree on the damages to a member vehicle, we reduce the claim by the amount of the deductible and send a check to the member for the remainder.  The property deductible applies in exactly the same way.  A third party deductible comes in to play in a liability scenario, most often in Errors and Omission and Law Enforcement Liability claims.  In this scenario, the member is billed for the deductible once it is paid on the claim.  Expenses, such as defense attorney legal fees, do accrue to the deductible, and the member is billed once TNRMT incurs costs that meet or exceed the deductible by making a settlement with the injured party or paying reasonable expenses to defend the claim.</p><a class="arrow" href="#morefaq">More</a>

                        <p class="q">What subjects can SEC train our staff on?</p>
                        <p class="a">This following is a list of some of our more popular topics.  It is not all inclusive.

                        <p class="q">Do we pursue recovery from an at-fault party who causes damages to a TNRMT members covered property?</p>
                        <p class="a">If an independent, at-fault party is responsible for damages to a member’s covered property and TNRMT reimburses the member under the coverage terms, TNRMT is subrogated to the member’s legal rights against the responsible party.  It is our policy to pursue recovery against all third parties and we will seek recovery through every available recourse as long as it makes economic sense.  If we are successful in making a full recovery, we will then reimburse the members’ deductible in full as well.</p>
                        <p class="q">A county-owned park has a concrete pad on which local kids built skate ramps. They leave them there and use them as they want. The skate ramps are not well built and the park department has put up a sign “Use At Your Own Risk”. Is the county liable if someone is injured while using poorly constructed or deteriorating equipment?</p>
                        <p class="a">The county has premises liability coverage.  The county MAY be held liable for any bodily injury sustained on county premises.  It could be argued that the county has accepted liability by allowing these skate ramps to remain and be used on county premises.  The court would have to decide if the “USE AT YOUR OWN RISK” sign is sufficient to remove the liability of the county.  Since you say they are not well built, it would seem the county is on notice of a defective condition.  To merely put up the sign could be construed as condoning the dangerous situation, not taking appropriate steps to remedy it.  This is a topic which should be discussed with the county attorney, BUT WE WOULD RECOMMEND THEY BE REMOVED UNLESS THEY ARE DESIGNED BY AN ARCHITECT AND PROFESSIONAL INSTALLED.</p>
                        <p class="q">Is the windshield and equipment on a fire truck covered in our policy?</p>
                        <p class="a">The glass breakage would be covered under the comprehensive coverage with your Comprehensive deductible applied.  If the equipment is permanently attached to the fire truck, then it is considered as part of the vehicle and the appropriate Comprehensive deductible would be applied when considering the total damage to the vehicle following an accident. If the equipment is not permanently attached to the vehicle, the coverage would be under the Inland Marine and that deductible would apply should a loss occur.</p>
                        <p class="q">What type of Training is offered by SEC?</p>
                        <p class="a">At SEC, we believe in hands-on and face-to-face training. The practice of popping in a video tape for safety training is overdone and is one of the least effective means of communicating information. The typical training you will receive is a staff safety consultant at your location on your terms for 45 minutes to maximize the retention of information. We utilize visual aids and the latest technology to enhance learning and promote discussions that will lead to proven results. We are happy to go into the field for confined space review, hands on lock out tag out training, and other on-site training.</p><a class="arrow" href="#faq">FAQ</a>
